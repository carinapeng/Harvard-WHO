# Harvard-WHO

This project contains working code and models for a collaboration between Harvard Data Analytics and the World Health Organization.

We were able to successfully create an interface that displays estimated transmission rates and epidemic curves of the COVID-19 virus based on the number of COVID-19 cases for a given country. 

This interface will help the World Health Organization and many countries successfully monitor transmission rates and prescribe public policies addressing the COVID-19 epidemic.
